# Install or upgrade goscaffold on Linux or macOS, from its latest GitHub release:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluffynuts/goscaffold/master/install.sh | sh
#
# Downloads the release zip for this machine into a temporary folder, checks
# it against the release's SHA256SUMS, unpacks it into another, and runs
# goscaffold --install from there. Anything after "sh -s --" is passed on to
# --install, should it ever grow options:
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- <options>
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: "| sh" is dash on Debian and Ubuntu, not bash.
# Once goscaffold is installed, goscaffold --upgrade does the same job.
